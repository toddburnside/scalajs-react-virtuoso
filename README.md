# scalajs-react-virtuoso

_This repository is no longer maintained. Some equivalent functionality can be found in https://github.com/gemini-hlsw/lucuma-react_

A scalajs facade for [react-virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev/)

The facade has only been developed to the point where it is useful in [scalajs-react-table](https://github.com/toddburnside/scalajs-react-table). This essentially means that most of the Virtuoso component has been completed.
